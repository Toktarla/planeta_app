      "description": "Minor Planet",
      "explanation": "Mercury is a rocky planet with a surface scarred by craters, similar in appearance to our Moon. It has extreme temperature variations, with scorching hot days and freezing cold nights due to its lack of atmosphere to retain heat. Mercury takes just 88 Earth days to orbit the Sun and rotates very slowly, with one day on Mercury lasting about 59 Earth days. It has been explored by several spacecraft, including NASA's MESSENGER mission, which revealed valuable insights about its composition and geology.",

It experiences a runaway greenhouse effect, making it one of the hottest planets in our solar system. The surface is marked by vast plains, volcanoes, and highland regions. Despite its challenging conditions, spacecraft like the Soviet Venera missions and NASA's Magellan have provided valuable data about Venus's surface and atmosphere.",

It has a unique atmosphere, rich in oxygen and nitrogen, which is crucial for sustaining life as we know it. Earth orbits the Sun at just the right distance, allowing for a temperate climate that supports a wide variety of species. The presence of liquid water and a stable climate make it a haven for life, including humans.",

It features a diverse landscape, including massive volcanoes like Olympus Mons, a vast canyon system known as Valles Marineris, and evidence of ancient river valleys and lake beds. Mars has been a target for exploration, with rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance searching for signs of past or present life. Future missions aim to prepare for potential human colonization.",

It has a dynamic atmosphere filled with colorful cloud bands and a massive storm known as the Great Red Spot. Jupiter also hosts a system of dozens of moons, including the four largest, known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

These rings are divided into numerous ringlets and are a subject of scientific study and fascination. Saturn also boasts a diverse collection of moons, with Titan being one of the most intriguing due to its thick atmosphere and potential for liquid lakes of methane and ethane.

      "description": "Ice Colossal",
      "explanation": "Uranus is unique among the planets in our solar system because it rotates on its side, likely due to a past collision. This axial tilt results in extreme seasons and a peculiar magnetic field orientation. The planet's blue-green color is attributed to the absorption of red light by its methane-rich atmosphere. Uranus has a ring system and a collection of moons, some of which were discovered by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its flyby in 1986.",

This hypothetical Neptune-sized planet orbits our Sun in a highly elongated orbit far beyond Pluto. The object, which the researchers have nicknamed \"Planet Nine,\" could have a mass about 10 times that of Earth and orbit about 20 times farther from the Sun on average than Neptune.

Like Luke Skywalker's home planet Tatooine, Kepler-16b would have two sunsets if you could stand on its surface. This planet, however, is likely cold, about the size of Saturn and gaseous, though partly composed of rock. It lies outside its two stars’ “habitable zone,” where liquid water could exist",
